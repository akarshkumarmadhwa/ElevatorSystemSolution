# ElevatorSystemSolution

The elevator system with N number of elevator is to decide whether the elevator should go up, go down, or stop. We'll ignore a lot of what goes into a real world elevator, like physics, maintenance overrides, and optimizations for traffic patterns. Now some user comes in and makes a request to an elevator. The elevator automatically moves UP/DOWN as per the request of the user. The status of an elevator like it is currently operational or not can be updated using API calls.
The status of an elevator like it is currently operational or not operational, can be updated using API calls. Visit the [Api_details.md](https://github.com/akarshkumarmadhwa/ElevatorSystemSolution/blob/main/elevator_system/Api_details.md) for further information.

 CREATE USER user WITH PASSWORD 'password';
 CREATE DATABASE "elevator_system_db" WITH OWNER "user" ENCODING 'UTF8' LC_COLLATE = 'en_US.UTF-8' LC_CTYPE = 'en_US.UTF-8' TEMPLATE template0;
 ALTER ROLE user SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
 ALTER ROLE user SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';

# Configure the database (PostgreSQL example)
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'elevator_system_db',
        'USER': 'user',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
